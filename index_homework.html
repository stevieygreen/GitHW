<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Use about 4-6 quarts of water per pound of pasta.</li>
    <li>Add a generous amount of salt to the boiling water. Aim for about 1-2 tablespoons of salt per pound of pasta.</li>
    <li>Add the pasta to the boiling water, and stir gently to prevent the pasta from sticking together.</li>
    <li>Cook the pasta for the recommended amount of time on the package, stirring occasionally. Be sure to test the pasta for doneness a few minutes before the recommended cooking time is up, as different brands and types of pasta may cook at different rates.</li>
    <li>Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.</li>
    <li>Drain the pasta in a colander, shaking gently to remove excess water.</li>
    <li>Return the pasta to the pot or a large bowl, and toss it with a bit of olive oil or butter to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li>Serve the pasta immediately, topped with your favorite sauce and any additional toppings or garnishes. If the pasta seems dry, you can add a bit of the reserved cooking water to moisten it.</li>
